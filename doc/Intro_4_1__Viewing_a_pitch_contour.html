Intro 4.1. Viewing a pitch contour
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
To see the pitch contour of an existing sound as a function of time, select a <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> or <a href="LongSound.html">LongSound</a> object and choose <a href="View___Edit.html">View & Edit</a>. A <a href="SoundEditor.html">SoundEditor</a> window will appear on your screen. The bottom half of this window will contain a pitch contour, drawn as a blue line or as a sequence of blue dots. If you do not see the pitch contour, choose <a href="Show_pitch.html">Show pitch</a> from the <b>Pitch</b> menu.</p>
<p>
To the right of the window, you may see three pitch values, written with blue digits: at the bottom, you see the floor of the viewable pitch range, perhaps 75 Hz; at the top, you see the ceiling of the pitch range, perhaps 600 Hz; and somewhere in between, you see the pitch value at the cursor, or the average pitch in the selection.</p>
