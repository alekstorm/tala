This is a description of the articulatory synthesis package in Praat. For a detailed description of the physics and mathematics behind the model, see <a href="Boersma__1998_.html">Boersma (1998)</a>, chapters 2 and 3. For examples of how to synthesize utterances, consult http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/paul/diss/ch5/.</p>
<h3>
How to start (after reading the <a href="Intro.html">Intro</a>)</h3>
<p>
We are going to have the synthesizer say [&#601;p&#601;]. We need a <a href="Speaker.html">Speaker</a> and an <a href="Artword.html">Artword</a> object.</p>
<p>
1. Create a speaker with <a href="Create_Speaker___.html">Create Speaker...</a> from the <a href="New_menu.html">New menu</a>.</p>
<p>
2. Create an articulation word of 0.5 seconds with <a href="Create_Artword___.html">Create Artword...</a>.</p>
<p>
3. Edit the Artword by selecting it and clicking <b>View &amp; Edit</b>.</p>
<p>
4. To set the glottis to a position suitable for phonation, use the ArtwordEditor to set the <i>Interarytenoid</i> activity to 0.5 throughout the utterance. You set two targets: 0.5 at a time of 0 seconds, and 0.5 at a time of 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p>
5. To prevent air escaping from the nose, close the nasopharyngeal port by setting the <i>LevatorPalatini</i> activity to 1.0 throughout the utterance.</p>
<p>
6. To generate the lung pressure needed for phonation, you set the <i>Lungs</i> activity at 0 seconds to 0.2, and at 0.1 seconds to 0.</p>
<p>
7. To force a jaw movement that closes the lips, set the <i>Masseter</i> activity at 0.25 seconds to 0.7, and the <i>OrbicularisOris</i> activity at 0.25 seconds to 0.2.</p>
<p>
8. Select the Speaker and the Artword and click <b>Movie</b>; you will see a closing-and-opening gesture of the mouth.</p>
<p>
9. Select the Speaker and the Artword and click <b>To Sound...</b> (see <a href="Artword___Speaker__To_Sound___.html">Artword & Speaker: To Sound...</a>).</p>
<p>
10. Just click <b>OK</b>; the synthesis starts.</p>
<p>
11. If you are sitting at a 1997 computer, this will last for 5 minutes or so; at a 2010 computer, 6 seconds. If this is too slow for you, click <b>Interrupt</b>. Otherwise, you can watch the vibrating vocal cords and the changing vocal-tract shape.</p>
<p>
12. You can play, view, and analyse the resulting <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> as you would any other. You can see and hear a sound movie if you select the Speaker, the Artword, and the Sound, and click <b>Play</b>.</p>
