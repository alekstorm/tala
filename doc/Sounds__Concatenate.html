Sounds: Concatenate
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
A command to concatenate all selected <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> objects into a single large Sound.</p>
<p>
All sounds must have equal sampling frequencies and equal numbers of channels. They are concatenated in the order in which they appear in the list of objects (not in the order in which you select them; remember: What You See Is What You Get).</p>
<h3>
How to concatenate directly to a file</h3>
<p>
If the resulting sound does not fit into memory, use one of the commands in the <a href="Save_menu.html">Save menu</a>. See <a href="How_to_concatenate_sound_files.html">How to concatenate sound files</a>.</p>

<p>
If you want the sounds to fade into each other smoothly, choose <a href="Sounds__Concatenate_with_overlap___.html">Sounds: Concatenate with overlap...</a> instead.</p>
