<b>Question</b>: how do I do something to all the files in a directory?</p>
<p>
Answer: look at <a href="Create_Strings_as_file_list___.html">Create Strings as file list...</a>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Question</b>: why doesn't the editor window react to my commands?</p>
<p>
Your commands are probably something like:</p>
<code>
Read from file... hello.wav<br></code>
<code>
View &amp; Edit<br></code>
<code>
Zoom... 0.3 0.5<br></code>
<p>
Answer: Praat doesn't know it has to send the <b>Zoom</b> command to the editor window called <b>Sound hello</b>. There could be several Sound editor windows on your screen. According to <a href="Scripting_7_1__Scripting_an_editor_from_a_shell_script.html">Scripting 7.1. Scripting an editor from a shell script</a>, you will have to say this explicitly:</p>
<code>
Read from file... hello.wav<br></code>
<code>
View &amp; Edit<br></code>
<code>
editor Sound hello<br></code>
<code>
Zoom... 0.3 0.5<br></code>

<b>Problem</b>: a line like "Number = 1" does not work.</p>
<p>
Solution: names of variables should start with a lower-case letter.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Question</b>: why do names of variables have to start with a lower-case letter? I would like to do things like "F0 = Get mean pitch".</p>
<p>
Answer: Praat scripts combine button commands with things that only occur in scripts. Button commands always start with a capital letter, e.g. "Play". Script command always start with lower case, e.g. "echo Hello". A minimal pair is "select", which simulates a mouse click in the object list, versus "Select...", which sets the selection in editor windows. Variable names that start with a capital letter would be rather ambiguous in assignments, as in "x = Get", where "Get" would be a variable, versus "x = Get mean", where "Get mean" is a button command. To prevent this, Praat enforces a rigorous lower-case/upper-case distinction.</p>
