	"/(\\si \\si\\'^) \\si/ in iambic left-aligning languages (I\\s{AMBIC} >> T\\s{ROCHAIC}, and A\\s{LL}F\\s{EET}L\\s{EFT} "
	">> A\\s{LL}F\\s{EET}R\\s{IGHT}), but as the surface form /\\si (\\si\\'^ \\si)/ in trochaic right-aligning languages. "
	"Tesar & Smolensky call this procedure @@Robust Interpretive Parsing@, because it works even if the listener's grammar "

	"A\\s{LL}F\\s{EET}L\\s{EFT}, the listener herself would produce the iambic right-aligned /\\si (\\si \\si\\'^)/ "
	"for any trisyllabic underlying form, though she will still interpret [\\si \\si\\'^ \\si] as /(\\si \\si\\'^) \\si/, "
	"which is illegal in her own grammar. Hearing forms that are illegal in one's own grammar is of course a common "
	"situation for language-learning children.")
NORMAL (L"In Tesar & Smolensky's view, the underlying form can be trivially computed from the surface form, "
	"since the surface form %contains enough information. For instance, the surface form /(\\si \\si\\'^) \\si/ must "

	"@@McCarthy & Prince (1995)@, this %containment view of surface representations has been abandoned. "
	"In Praat, therefore, the underlying form is not trivially computed from the surface form, "
	"but all the tableaus are scanned for the surface form that violates the least high-ranked constraints (in the usual "
	"OT sense), as long as it contains the given overt form. For instance, if I\\s{AMBIC} >> A\\s{LL}F\\s{EET}R\\s{IGHT} "

	"\\|f\\si \\si \\si\\|f (the 'winning tableau') and to the surface form /(\\si \\si\\'^) \\si/ (to be sure, "
