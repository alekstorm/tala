NORMAL (L"#Question: what algorithm is used for pitch analysis?")
NORMAL (L"Answer: see @@Sound: To Pitch (ac)...@. The 1993 article is downloadable from "
	"http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/paul/")
NORMAL (L"#Question: why does Praat consider my sound voiceless while I hear it as voiced?")
NORMAL (L"There are at least five possibilities. Most of them can be checked by zooming in on the @waveform.")
NORMAL (L"The first possibility is that the pitch has fallen below the @@pitch floor@. For instance, "
	"your pitch floor could be 75 Hz but the English speaker produces creak at the end of the utterance. "
	"Or your pitch floor could be 75 Hz but the Chinese speaker is in the middle of a third tone. "
	"If this happens, it may help to lower the pitch floor to e.g. 40 Hz (@@Pitch settings...@), "
	"although that may also smooth the pitch curve too much in other places.")
NORMAL (L"The second possibility is that the pitch has moved too fast. This could happen at the end of a Chinese fourth tone, "
	"which drops very fast. If this happens, it may help to use the \"optimize for voice analysis\" setting, "
	"(@@Pitch settings...@), although Praat may then hallucinate pitches in other places that you would prefer to consider voiceless.")
NORMAL (L"The third possibility is that the periods are very irregular, as in some pathological voices. "
	"If you want to see a pitch in those cases, it may help to use the \"optimize for voice analysis\" setting "
	"(@@Pitch settings...@). Or it may help to lower the \"voicing threshold\" setting (@@Advanced pitch settings...@) "
	"to 0.25 (instead of the standard 0.45) or so.")
NORMAL (L"The fourth possibility is that there is a lot of background noise, as in a recording on a busy street. "
	"In such a case, it may help to lower the \"voicing threshold\" setting (@@Advanced pitch settings...@) "
	"to 0.25 (instead of the standard 0.45) or so. The disadvantage of lowering this setting is that for non-noisy "
	"recordings, Praat will become too eager to find voicing in some places that you would prefer to consider voiceless; "
	"so make sure to set it back to 0.45 once you have finished analysing the noisy recordings.")
NORMAL (L"The fifth possibility is that the part analysed as voiceless is much less loud than the rest of the sound, "
	"or that the sound contains a loud noise elsewhere. This can be checked by zooming in on the part analysed as voiceless: "
	"if Praat suddenly considers it as voiced, this is a sign that this part is much quieter than the rest. "
	"To make Praat analyse this part as voiced, you can lower the \"silence threshold\" setting to 0.01 "
	"(instead of the standard 0.03) or so. The disadvantage of lowering this setting is that Praat may start to consider "
	"some distant background sounds (and quiet echos, for instance) as voiced.")
NORMAL (L"#Question: why do I get different results for the maximum pitch if...?")

NORMAL (L"This is normal. Spectral analysis requires an %%analysis window% of a certain duration. "
	"For instance, if Praat wants to know the spectrum at 1.342 seconds, it needs to include information "
	"about the signal in a 10-milliseconds window around this time point, i.e., Praat will use "
	"signal information about all times between 1.337 and 1.347 seconds. At the very edges of the sound, "
	"this information is not available: "
	"if the sound runs from 0 to 1.8 seconds, no spectrum can be computed between 0 and 0.005 "
	"seconds or between 1.795 and 1.800 seconds. Hence the white stripes. If you do not see them "

	"But Praat did not forget what the signal looks like just outside the edges of this time window. "
	"To display a spectrogram from 0.45 to 1.35 seconds, Praat will use information from the wave form "
	"between 0.445 and 1.355 seconds, and if this is available, you will see no white stripes at the edges of the window.")
ENTRY (L"Hey, it changes when I scroll!")
NORMAL (L"This is normal as well, especially for long windows. If your visible time window is 20 seconds long, "

	"then you might think that every one-pixel-wide vertical line should represent the spectrum of 20 milliseconds of sound. "
	"But for reasons of computation speed, Praat will only show the spectrum of the part of the sound "
	"that lies around the centre of those 20 milliseconds, "
	"not the average or sum of all the spectra in those 20 milliseconds. "
	"This %undersampling of the underlying spectrogram is different from what happens in the drawing of the wave form, "
	"where a vertical black line connects the minimum and maximum amplitude of all the samples that fall inside a "
	"screen pixel. We cannot do something similar for spectrograms. And since scrolling goes by fixed time steps "
	"(namely, 5 percent of the duration of the visible window), rather than by a whole number of screen pixels, "
	"the centres of the pixels will fall in different parts of the spectrogram with each scroll. "
	"Hence the apparent changes. If your visible window is shorter than a couple of seconds, "
	"the scrolling spectrogram will appear much smoother.")
NORMAL (L"The darkness of the spectrogram will also change when you scroll, because the visible part with the most "

TAG (L"%%Window length")
DEFINITION (L"the duration of the analysis window. If this is 0.005 seconds (the standard), "
	"Praat uses for each frame the part of the sound that lies between 0.0025 seconds before "
	"and 0.0025 seconds after the centre of that frame "
	"(for Gaussian windows, Praat actually uses a bit more than that). "
	"The window length determines the %bandwidth of the spectral analysis, "
	"i.e. the width of the horizontal line in the spectrogram of a pure sine wave (see below). "
	"For a Gaussian window, the -3 dB bandwidth is 2*sqrt(6*ln(2))/(\\pi*%%Window length%), "
	"or 1.2982804 / %%Window length%. "
	"To get a `broad-band' spectrogram (bandwidth 260 Hz), keep the standard window length of 5 ms; "
	"to get a `narrow-band' spectrogram (bandwidth 43 Hz), set it to 30 ms (0.03 seconds). "
	"The other window shapes give slightly different values.")
TAG (L"%%Dynamic range% (dB)")
DEFINITION (L"All values that are more than %%Dynamic range% dB below the maximum (perhaps after dynamic compression, "
	"see @@Advanced spectrogram settings...@) "
	"will be drawn in white. Values in-between have appropriate shades of grey. Thus, if the highest "
	"peak in the spectrogram has a height of 30 dB/Hz, and the dynamic range is 50 dB (which is the standard value), "
	"then values below -20 dB/Hz will be drawn in white, and values between -20 dB/Hz and 30 dB/Hz will be drawn "
	"in various shades of grey.")
ENTRY (L"The bandwidth")
NORMAL (L"To see how the window length influences the bandwidth, "
	"first create a 1000-Hz sine wave with @@Create Sound from formula...@ "
	"by typing $$1/2 * sin (2*pi*1000*x)$ as the formula, then click ##View & Edit#. "
	"The spectrogram will show a horizontal black line. "
	"You can now vary the window length in the spectrogram settings and see how the thickness "
	"of the lines varies. The line gets thinner if you raise the window length. "
	"Apparently, if the analysis window comprises more periods of the wave, "
	"the spectrogram can tell us the frequency of the wave with greater precision.")
NORMAL (L"To see this more precisely, create a sum of two sine waves, with frequencies of 1000 and 1200 Hz. "
	"the formula is $$1/4 * sin (2*pi*1000*x) + 1/4 * sin (2*pi*1200*x)$. In the editor, you will see "
	"a single thick band if the analysis window is short (5 ms), and two separate bands if the analysis "
	"window is long (30 ms). Apparently, the frequency resolution gets better with longer analysis windows.")
NORMAL (L"So why don't we always use long analysis windows? The answer is that their time resolution is poor. "
	"To see this, create a sound that consists of two sine waves and two short clicks. The formula is "
	"$$0.02*(sin(2*pi*1000*x)+sin(2*pi*1200*x)) + (col=10000)+(col=10200)$. "
	"If you view this sound, you can see that the two clicks will overlap "
	"in time if the analysis window is long, and that the sine waves overlap in frequency if the "
	"analysis window is short. Apparently, there is a trade-off between time resolution and "
	"frequency resolution. One cannot know both the time and the frequency with great precision.")

	"The Gaussian window is superior, as it gives no %sidelobes in your spectrogram (see below); "

	"Praat will use the maximum of the visible part of the spectrogram instead; "

NORMAL (L"Here is why you have to supply these settings. If the pitch floor is 75 Hz, "

ENTRY (L"ASCII text files")

	"or Hebrew characters such as \\?+\\B+\\G+\\M%\\vO\\sU, "
	"then when you say @@Save as text file...@ or #Save, Praat will write an UTF-16 text file, "
	"which is a text file in which every character is encoded in two bytes (and some very rare characters in four bytes). "
	"Many programs can read such text files, for instance NotePad, WordPad, Microsoft Word, and TextWrangler.")
ENTRY (L"What if my other programs cannot read UTF-16 text files?")
NORMAL (L"If you want to export your Table to Microsoft Excel or to SPSS, or if you want your TextGrid file to be read "
	"by somebody else's Perl script, then there will be no problem if your Table contains only ASCII characters (see above). "
	"But if your Table contains any other (i.e. non-ASCII) characters, you may be in trouble, because Praat will write the Table "
	"as an UTF-16 text file, and not all of the programs just mentioned can read such files yet.")
NORMAL (L"What you can do is go to ##Text writing preferences...# in the #Preferences submenu of the #Praat menu, "
	"and there set the output encoding to ##UTF-8#. Praat will from then on save your text files in the UTF-8 format, "
	"which means one byte for every ASCII character and 2 to 4 bytes for every non-ASCII character. "
	"Especially on Linux, many programs understand UTF-8 text and will display the correct characters. "
	"Programs such as SPSS do not understand UTF-8 but will still display ASCII characters correctly; "
	"for instance, the names M\\u\"nchen and Wa\\l/\\e;sa may appear as M\\A~\\:-nchen and Wa\\Ao,\\A\"\\TMsa or so.")
NORMAL (L"If you can get by with West-European characters (on Windows), "
	"then you may choose ##try ISO Latin-1, then UTF-16# for the output encoding. "
	"It is possible (but not guaranteed) that programs like SPSS then display your West-European text correctly. "
	"This trick is of limited use, because it will not work if your operating system is set to a \"codepage\" "
	"differently from ISO Latin-1 (or \"ANSI\"), or if you need East-European or Hebrew characters, or if you want "
	"to share your text files with Macintosh users.")
NORMAL (L"If you already have some UTF-16 text files and you want to convert them to UTF-8 or ISO Latin-1 (the latter only if "
	"they do not contain non-West-European characters), then you can read them into Praat and save them again "
	"(with the appropriate output encoding setting). "
	"Other programs, such a NotePad and TextWrangler, can also do this conversion.")

	"as \\bsss and \\bso: respectively. See @@special symbols@.")
