/*
	Cell [i,j] of a CrossCorrelationTable contains the cross-correlation between signal i and signal j.
	For example, the CrossCorrelation of an n-channel sound is a nxn table where cell [i,j] contains the
	cross-correlation of channel i with channel j for a particlular lag time tau.
	In the statistical literature sometimes the cross-correlation between signals is also called "covariance".
	However, the only thing a Covariance has in common with a CrossCorrelationTable is that both are symmetric
	matrices. Differences between a CrossCorrelationTable and a Covariance:
	1. a Covariance matrix is always positive definite, for a cross-correlation table this is only guaranteed for
	  lag time tau = 0.
	2. The elements c[i][j] in a Covariance always satisfy |c[i][j]/sqrt(c[i][i]*c[j][j])| <= 1, this is
	  in general not the case for cross-correlations.
