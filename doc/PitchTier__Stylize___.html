PitchTier: Stylize...
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
A command that modifies the selected <a href="PitchTier.html">PitchTier</a> object (or the pitch curve in the <a href="ManipulationEditor.html">ManipulationEditor</a>).</p>
<h3>
Purpose</h3>
<p>
to end up with a much simplified pitch curve.</p>
<h3>
Settings</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Frequency resolution</b> (standard: 2.0 semitones)
<dd>
the minimum amount by which every remaining pitch point will lie above or below the line that connects its two neigbours.
</dl>
<h3>
Algorithm</h3>
<dl>
<dd>
1. Look up the pitch point that is closest to the straight line that connects its two neighbouring points.
<dd>
2. If this pitch point is further away from that straight line than <b>Frequency resolution</b>, we are finished: the curve cannot be stylized any further.
<dd>
3. If we are not finished, the pitch point we found in step 1 is removed.
<dd>
4. Go back to step 1.
