Formulas 8. Data in objects
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
With square brackets, you can get the values inside some objects.</p>
<h3>
Object contents in the calculator</h3>
<p>
The outcomes of the following examples can be checked with the <a href="Calculator.html">calculator</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Matrix_hello [10, 3]</b>
<dd>
gives the value in the cell at the third column of the 10th row of the Matrix called <i>hello</i>.
<dt>
<b>Sound_hello [0, 10000]</b>
<dd>
gives the value (in Pa) of the 1000th sample of the Sound <i>hello</i>, averaged over the channels.
<dt>
<b>Sound_hello [1, 10000]</b>
<dd>
gives the value (in Pa) of the 1000th sample of the left channel of the Sound <i>hello</i>.
<dt>
<b>Sound_hello [2, 10000]</b>
<dd>
gives the value (in Pa) of the 1000th sample of the right channel of the Sound <i>hello</i>.
<dt>
<b>Sound_hello [10000]</b>
<dd>
this can mean various things. In the calculator it means the same as <b>Sound_hello [0, 10000]</b>, but in modification formulas it can mean <b>Sound_hello [row, 10000]</b>, where <i>row</i> refers to the channel. This variation exists in order to make older Praat scripts (from the time that Praat did not support stereo) compatible with present-day Praat versions; because of possible confusions, the use of <b>Sound_hello [10000]</b> is not recommended.
<dt>
<b>TableOfReal_tokens [5, 12]</b>
<dd>
gives the value in the cell at the fifth row of the 12th column of the TableOfReal called <i>tokens</i>.
<dt>
<b>TableOfReal_tokens [5, "F1"]</b>
<dd>
gives the value in the cell at the fifth row of the column labelled <i>F1</i> of the TableOfReal <i>tokens</i>.
<dt>
<b>TableOfReal_tokens ["\ct", "F1"]</b>
<dd>
gives the value in the cell at the row labelled <i>\ct</i> of column <i>F1</i> of the TableOfReal <i>tokens</i>.
<dt>
<b>Table_listeners [3, "m3ae"]</b>
<dd>
gives the numeric value in the cell at the third row of column <i>m3ae</i> of the Table <i>listeners</i>.
<dt>
<b>Table_listeners [3, 12]</b>
<dd>
gives the numeric value in the cell at the third row of the 12th column of the Table <i>listeners</i>.
<dt>
<b>Table_results$ [3, "response"]</b>
<dd>
gives the string value in the cell at the third row of column <i>response</i> of the Table <i>results</i>.
<dt>
<b>Table_results$ [3, 12]</b>
<dd>
gives the string value in the cell at the third row of the 12th column of the Table <i>results</i>.
<dt>
<b>PitchTier_hello [8]</b>
<dd>
gives the pitch (in Hertz) of the 8th point in the PitchTier <i>hello</i>.
</dl>
<p>
Cells (or samples, or points) outside the objects are considered to contain zeroes.</p>
<h3>
Interpolation</h3>
<p>
The values inside some objects can be interpolated.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Sound_hello (0.7, 0)</b>
<dd>
gives the value (in Pa) at a time of 0.7 seconds in the Sound <i>hello</i>, by linear interpolation between the two samples that are nearest to 0.7 seconds. The channels are averaged.
<dt>
<b>Sound_hello (0.7, 1)</b>
<dd>
gives the interpolated value (in Pa) at a time of 0.7 seconds in the left channel of the Sound <i>hello</i>.
<dt>
<b>Sound_hello (0.7, 2)</b>
<dd>
gives the interpolated value (in Pa) at a time of 0.7 seconds in the right channel of the Sound <i>hello</i>.
<dt>
<b>Sound_hello (0.7)</b>
<dd>
this can mean various things. In the calculator it means the same as <b>Sound_hello (0.7, 0)</b>, but in modification formulas it can mean <b>Sound_hello (0.7, row)</b>, where <i>row</i> refers to the channel. This variation exists in order to make older Praat scripts (from the time that Praat did not support stereo) compatible with present-day Praat versions; because of possible confusions, the use of <b>Sound_hello (0.7)</b> is not recommended.
<dt>
<b>Spectrogram_hallo (0.7, 2500)</b>
<dd>
gives the value at a time of 0.7 seconds and at a frequency of 2500 Hz in the Spectrogram <i>hallo</i>, by linear interpolation between the four samples that are nearest to that point.
<dt>
<b>PitchTier_hullo (0.7)</b>
<dd>
gives the pitch (in Hertz) at a time of 0.7 seconds in the PitchTier <i>hullo</i>.
</dl>
<p>
In the interpolation, times outside the time domain of the objects are considered to contain zeroes (this does not apply to PitchTiers and the like, which undergo <a href="constant_extrapolation.html">constant extrapolation</a>).</p>
<h3>
Object contents in a modification formula</h3>
<p>
Suppose you want to do the difficult way of reversing the contents of a Sound called <i>hello</i> (the easy way is to choose <b>Reverse</b> from the <a href="Modify.html">Modify</a> menu). You select this sound, then choose <a href="Copy___.html">Copy...</a> to duplicate it to a new Sound, which you name <i>hello_reverse</i>. You select this new Sound and choose <b>Formula...</b> from the <a href="Modify.html">Modify</a> menu. The formula will be</p>
<code>
Sound_hello [ncol + 1 - col]<br></code>
<p>
From this example, you see that the indices between [ ] may be formulas themselves, and that you can use implicit attributes like <i>ncol</i> and position references like <i>col</i>. An alternative formula is</p>
<code>
Sound_hello (xmax - x)<br></code>
<p>
at least if <i>xmin</i> is zero. The advantage of the second method is that is also works correctly if the two sounds have different sampling frequencies; the disadvantage is that it may do some interpolation between the samples, which deteriorates the sound quality.</p>
<h3>
Object contents in a script</h3>
<p>
In scripts, the indices between [ ] and the values between ( ) may be formulas themselves and contain variables. The following script computes the sum of all the cells along the diagonal of a Matrix named <i>hello</i>.</p>
<code>
sumDiagonal = 0<br></code>
<code>
for i to Matrix_hello.ncol<br></code>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
sumDiagonal += Matrix_hello [i, i]<br></code>
<code>
endfor<br></code>
<code>
echo The sum of cells along the diagonal is 'sumDiagonal'.<br></code>
<p>
This example could have been written completely with commands from the dynamic menu:</p>
<code>
select Matrix hello<br></code>
<code>
sumDiagonal = 0<br></code>
<code>
ncol = Get number of columns<br></code>
<code>
for i to ncol<br></code>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
value = Get value in cell... i i<br></code>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
sumDiagonal += value<br></code>
<code>
endfor<br></code>
<code>
echo The sum of cells along the diagonal is 'sumDiagonal'.<br></code>
<p>
The first version, which accesses the contents directly, is not only three lines shorter, but also three times faster.</p>
