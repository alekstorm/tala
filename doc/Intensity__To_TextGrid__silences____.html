Intensity: To TextGrid (silences)...

<p>
A command that creates a <a href="TextGrid.html">TextGrid</a> in which the silent and sounding intervals of the selected <a href="Intensity.html">Intensity</a> are marked.</p>
<h3>
Settings</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Silence threshold (dB)</b>
<dd>
determines the maximum silence intensity value in dB with respect to the maximum intensity. For example, if <i>imax</i> is the maximum intensity in dB then the maximum silence intensity is calculated as <i>imax - silenceThreshold</i>; intervals with an intensity smaller than this value are considered as silent intervals.
<dt>
<b>Minimum silent interval duration (s)</b>
<dd>
determines the minimum duration for an interval to be considered as silent. If you don't want the closure for a plosive to count as silent then use a large enough value.
<dt>
<b>Minimum sounding interval duration (s)</b>
<dd>
determines the minimum duration for an interval to be <b>not</b> considered as silent. This offers the possibility to filter out small intense bursts of relatively short duration.
<dt>
<b>Silent interval label</b>
<dd>
determines the label for a silent interval in the TextGrid.
<dt>
<b>Sounding interval label</b>
<dd>
determines the label for a sounding interval in the TextGrid.
</dl>
<h3>
Algorithm</h3>
<p>
First the intensity contour is evaluated and the intervals above and below the silence threshold are marked as <i>sounding</i> and <i>silent</i>. We then remove sounding intervals with a duration smaller than the <i>Minimum sounding interval duration</i>. This step is followed by joining the neighbouring silent intervals that resulted because of this removal. Finally we remove silent intervals with a duration smaller than the <i>Minimum silent interval duration</i>. This is followed by joining the neighbouring sounding intervals that resulted because of this removal.</p>
<p>
Experience showed that first removing short intensity bursts instead of short silences gave better results than doing it the other way around.</p>
<h3>
Important</h3>
<p>
The effectiveness of the <i>Minimum silent interval duration</i> and <i>Minimum sounding interval duration</i> depends on the effective analysis window duration that was used to determine the intensity contour. For example, if you have chosen 100 Hz for the "Minimum pitch" parameter in the <a href="Sound__To_Intensity___.html">Sound: To Intensity...</a> analysis, the effective analysis window duration was 32 ms. Don't expect to find sounding or silent intervals with a duration smaller than this effective analysis window duration.</p>
