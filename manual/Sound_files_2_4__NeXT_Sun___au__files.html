Sound files 2.4. NeXT/Sun (.au) files

<p>
This is the format of the sound files on the Sun.</p>
<h3>
Reading</h3>
<p>
To read a <b>Sound</b> from a Sun audio file on disk, use <a href="Read_from_file___.html">Read from file...</a>.Praat then asks you for a file name. After you click OK, Praat determines the encoding of the file. If the encoding is 16-bit linear, the 16-bit sample values are divided by 32768 so that the amplitude of the resulting Sound is between -1.0 and +1.0. If the encoding is 8-bit <i></i>&#956;-law, the 16-bit sample value is determined by table look-up first.</p>
<p>
The resulting Sound will appear in the list of objects; its name will be equal to the file name, without extension.</p>
<h3>
Saving</h3>
<p>
Use <a href="Save_as_NeXT_Sun_file___.html">Save as NeXT/Sun file...</a>. The samples of the Sound are multiplied by 32768 and quantized between -32768 and 32767; the result is written to the file in 16-bit mono Sun audio format.</p>
<p>
To avoid clipping, keep the absolute amplitude below 1.000. If the maximum sound pressure level is 91 dB (top = 32767), the quantization threshold is (top = 1/2) -5 dB.</p>
