<p>
A term that is often used in the context of machine learning. An epoch is one complete presentation of the <i>data set to be learned</i> to a learning machine.</p>
<p>
Learning machines like <a href="FFNet.html">feedforward neural nets</a> that use iterative algorithms often need many epochs during their learning phase.</p>
<p>
A <a href="Discriminant.html">discriminant classifier</a> is also a learning machine. However, in contrast with neural nets a discriminant classifier only needs one epoch to learn.</p>
