Feedforward neural networks 1. What is a feedforward neural network?

<p>
A feedforward neural network is a biologically inspired classification algorithm. It consist of a (possibly large) number of simple neuron-like processing <i>units</i>, organized in <i>layers</i>. Every unit in a layer is connected with all the units in the previous layer. These connections are not all equal, each connection may have a different strength or <i>weight</i>. The weights on these connections encode the knowledge of a network. Often the units in a neural network are also called <i>nodes</i>.</p>
<p>
Data enters at the inputs and passes through the network, layer by layer, until it arrives at the outputs. During normal operation, that is when it acts as a classifier, there is no feedback between layers. This is why they are called <i>feedforward</i> neural networks. </p>
<p>
In the following figure we see an example of a 2-layered network with, from top to bottom: an output layer with 5 units, a <i>hidden</i> layer with 4 units, respectively. The network has 3 input units.</p>
<p><font size=-2>[sorry, no pictures yet in the web version of this manual]</font></p>
<p>
The 3 inputs are shown as circles and these do not belong to any layer of the network (although the inputs sometimes are considered as a virtual layer with layer number 0). Any layer that is not an output layer is a <i>hidden</i> layer. This network therefore has 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer. The figure also shows all the connections between the units in different layers. A layer only connects to the previous layer. </p>
<p>
The operation of this network can be divided into two phases:</p>
