Permutation: Swap blocks...
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
A command to swap the contents of two index ranges in the selected <a href="Permutation.html">Permutation</a>.</p>
<h3>
Settings</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>From index</b>, <b>To index</b>
<dd>
the two starting positions from where elements are to be swapped. The blocks may overlap.
<dt>
<b>Block size</b>
<dd>
determines the number of pairs to swap. 
</dl>
<h3>
Behaviour</h3>
<p>
If the <b>Block size</b> equals one, only the elements at the <b>From index</b> and <b>To index</b> position are swapped. If blocksize is greater than one, the two elements at <b>From index</b>+1 and <b>To index</b>+1 will be swapped too. This goes on until the last two elements in each block have been swapped.</p>
<h3>
Examples</h3>
<p>
1. Swap two blocks: with <b>From index</b> = 1, <b>To index</b> = 4, and <b>Block size</b> = 2, the permutation (1,2,3,4,5) is turned into (4,5,3,1,2).</p>
<p>
2. Swap two elements: with <b>From index</b> = 1, <b>To index</b> = 4, and <b>Block size</b> = 1, the permutation (1,2,3,4,5) is turned into (4,2,3,1,5).</p>
<p>
3. Swap two overlapping blocks: with <b>From index</b> = 1, <b>To index</b> = 3, and <b>Block size</b> = 3, the permutation (1,2,3,4,5) is turned into (3,4,5,2,1).</p>
