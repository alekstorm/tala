	"or ##o.aifc# will be played.")
NORMAL (L"The format of the sound link \"$$\\@ \\@ \\bsFIo.aifc|o\\@ $\" is to be understood "
	"as follows. The pipe symbol separates the link information (\\bsFIo.aifc) from the viewable "
	"link text (o). The link information is introduced with a symbol (\\bsFI) that "
	"tells the manual system that a sound file name follows. The manual system reads "
	"this file, sees that it contains a sound, and plays that sound.")
NORMAL (L"You can use relative path names, e.g., \\bsFIsounds/o.aifc refers to the file "
	"##o.aifc# in the subdirectory #sounds, which must be contained in the same directory "
	"as the ##.man# files. To make sure that your manual pages run on all platforms "

ENTRY (L"Pictures as embedded scripts")

	"If the font size is larger, the viewport will be scaled up accordingly.")
NORMAL (L"Please note that the script is enclosed within double quotes. "
	"Therefore, you will have to double any double quotes that occur in the script.")
NORMAL (L"If needed, a script like this can create objects in the object list of the manual. "
	"However, you have to make sure that you remove them after use:")

CODE1 (L"plus Sound sineWithNoise")
CODE1 (L"Remove")
CODE (L"\\\"r")
NORMAL (L"Note that unlike the previous script, this script does not set the font and font size. "
	"This means that the drawing will use the font and font size of the manual page, "
	"which is usually what you want.")
NORMAL (L"For obvious safety reasons, embedded scripts cannot contain commands that change the contents of any disk "
	"or send messages. Thus, commands like ##Save as WAV file...#, ##filedelete out.txt#, ##string\\$  >> out.txt#, "
	"#system, or #sendpraat are forbidden. Several other commands, such as #pause and #editor, "
	"are irrelevant inside pictures and are therefore forbidden as well. "
	"Note that commands like #echo, ##Read from file...#, and #execute are still available "
	"(with the last two, you can use relative paths; "
	"with #execute, you can only run scripts that do not contain any of the forbidden commands).")
NORMAL (L"The commands ##Set outer viewport...# and ##Set inner viewport...# are available; "
	"they count in inches (if the font size of the manual is 12). The (0, 0) point is in the upper left corner, "
	"as in the Picture window, so that you can test your picture with a normal Praat script; "
	"for instance, the following script draw a cross in the bottom half of the picture and a rectangle in the upper half:")
