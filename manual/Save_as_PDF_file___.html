<p>
A command in the File menu of the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a>, on Macintosh only.</p>
<p>
It saves the picture to a PDF file, which can be imported by several other programs, such as Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Word&#8482; 2008 on the Mac.</p>
<h3>
PDF = PostScript = highest possible quality!</h3>
<p>
With PDF pictures you can use high-quality graphics in your word-processor documents. The quality is the same as if you use <a href="Copy_to_clipboard.html">Copy to clipboard</a>.</p>
<p>
On Windows or Linux, use <a href="Save_as_EPS_file___.html">Save as EPS file...</a> instead.</p>
<h3>
Behaviour</h3>
<p>
Though all the contents of the Picture window are written to the PDF file, only the part that you selected in the Picture window (the <i>viewport</i>) may become visible in Word (or another program).</p>
<h3>
Usage</h3>
<p>
To import a PDF file in Word 2008, choose <b>Insert</b> &#8594; <b>Picture</b> &#8594; <b>From file...</b>. Word will create a picture with the same size as the originally selected part of the Picture window (the <i>viewport</i>).</p>
<p>
Please note that if you save the Word document as a <b>.doc</b> file, Word will convert the PDF picture into a mediocre 300-dpi bitmap; therefore, you should save the document as a <b>.docx</b> file instead. If you cannot use <b>.docx</b> files (for instance because your publisher does not support these yet, or because you still use Word 2004), you may use <a href="Save_as_EPS_file___.html">Save as EPS file...</a>; the quality will be the same, but you cannot use Czech, Russian, Korean or Arabic characters in EPS files.</p>
