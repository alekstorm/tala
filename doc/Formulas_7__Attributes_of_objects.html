Formulas 7. Attributes of objects
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
You can refer to several attributes of objects that are visible in the <a href="List_of_Objects.html">List of Objects</a>. To do so, use the type and the name of the object, connected with an underscore. Thus, <code>Sound_hallo</code> refers to an existing Sound object whose name is "hallo" (if there is more than one such object, it refers to the one that was created last). You can also use the unique ID instead of the name. Thus, <code>Object_113</code> refers to the 113th object that you created in the list.</p>
<p>
To refer to an attribute, you use the period ( `.'). Thus, <code>Sound_hallo.nx</code> is the number of samples of Sound_hallo, and <code>1 / Sound_hallo.dx</code> is the sampling frequency of Sound_hallo.</p>
<h3>
Attributes in the calculator</h3>
<p>
Record a Sound (read the <a href="Intro.html">Intro</a> if you do not know how to do that), name it "mysound" (or anything else), and type the following formula into the <a href="Calculator.html">calculator</a>:</p>
<code>
Sound_mysound.nx<br></code>
<p>
After you click OK, the Info window will show the number of samples. Since you could have got this result by simply choosing <b><i>Get number of samples</b></i> from the <a href="Query.html">Query</a> menu, these attribute tricks are not very useful in the calculator. We will see that they are much more useful in creation and modification formulas and in scripts.</p>

<dd>
the highest frequency for a Spectrogram object, e.g. 5000 Hertz; the highest frequency for a Cochleagram object, often 25.6 Bark; the top of the <i>y</i> domain for a Matrix object.
<dt>
<b>ny</b>
<dd>

<dt>
<b>dy</b>
<dd>
the distance between adjacent frequency bands in a Spectrogram object, in Hertz; the distance between adjacent frequency bands in a Cochleagram object, in Hertz; the vertical distance between cells in a Matrix object.

<h3>
Attributes in a creation formula</h3>
<p>
In formulas for creating a new object, you can refer to the attributes of any object, but you will often want to refer to the attributes of the object that is just being created. You can do that in two ways.</p>
<p>
The first way is to use the name of the object, as above. Choose <a href="Create_Sound_from_formula___.html">Create Sound from formula...</a>, supply <i>hello</i> for its name, supply arbitrary values for the starting and finishing time, and type the following formula:</p>
<code>
(x - Sound_hello.xmin) / (Sound_hello.xmax - Sound_hello.xmin)<br></code>
<p>
When you edit this sound, you can see that it creates a straight line that rises from 0 to 1 within the time domain.</p>
<p>
The formula above will also work if the Sound under creation is called <i>goodbye</i>, and a Sound called <i>hello</i> already exists; of course, in such a case <code>Sound_hello.xmax</code> refers to a property of the already existing sound.</p>
<p>
If a formula refers to an object under creation, there is a shorter way: you do not have to supply the name of the object at all, so you can simply write</p>
<code>
(x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin)<br></code>
<p>
The attributes that you can use in this implicit way are <i>xmin</i>, <i>xmax</i>, <i>ncol</i>, <i>nrow</i>, <i>nx</i>, <i>dx</i>, <i>ny</i>, and <i>dy</i>. To disambiguate in case there exists a script variable <i>xmin</i> as well, you can write <i>Self.xmin</i>.</p>
<h3>
Attributes in a modification formula</h3>
<p>
In formulas for modifying an existing object, you refer to attributes in the same way as in creation formulas, i.e., you do not have to specify the name of the object that is being modified. The formula</p>
<code>
self * 20 ^ (- (x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin))<br></code>
<p>
causes the sound to decay exponentially in such a way that it has only 5 percent of its initial amplitude at the end. If you apply this formula to multiple Sound objects at the same time, <i>xmax</i> will refer to the finishing time of each Sound separately as it is modified. To disambiguate in case there exists a script variable <i>xmin</i> as well, you can write <i>Self.xmin</i>.</p>
<p>
More examples of the use of attributes are on the next page.</p>
