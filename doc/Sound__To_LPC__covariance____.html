Sound: To LPC (covariance)...
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
With this command you create a new <a href="LPC.html">LPC</a> from every selected <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a>, using "the covariance" method.</p>
<h3>
Warning</h3>
<p>
You are advised not to use this command for formant analysis. For formant analysis, instead use <a href="Sound__To_Formant__burg____.html">Sound: To Formant (burg)...</a>, which also works via LPC (linear predictive coding). This is because <b>Sound: To Formant (burg)...</b> lets you specify a maximum frequency, whereas the <b>To LPC</b> commands automatically use the <a href="Nyquist_frequency.html">Nyquist frequency</a> as their maximum frequency. If you do use one of the <b>To LPC</b> commands for formant analysis, you may therefore want to downsample the sound first. For instance, if you want five formants below 5500 Hz but your Sound has a sampling frequency of 44100 Hz, you have to downsample the sound to 11000 Hz with the <a href="Sound__Resample___.html">Sound: Resample...</a> command. After that, you can use the <b>To LPC</b> commands, with a prediction order of 10 or 11.</p>
<h3>
Settings</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Prediction order</b>
<dd>
the number of linear prediction coefficients, also called the <i>number of poles</i>. Choose this number at least twice as large as the number of spectral peaks that you want to detect.
<dt>
<b>Analysis window duration (s)</b>
<dd>
the effective duration of each analysis frame, in seconds.
<dt>
<b>Time step (s)</b>
<dd>
the time step between two consecutive analysis frames.
<dt>
<b>Pre-emphasis frequency (Hz)</b>
<dd>
a +6dB / octave filtering will be applied above this frequency. A pre-emphasis frequency of 48.47 Hz for a signal with a sampling frequency of 10 kHz approximately corresponds to a value of <i>a</i> = 0.97 for the filter <i>y</i><sub><i>n</sub></i> = <i>x</i><sub><i>n</sub></i> - <i>a</i> &#183; <i>x</i><sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>. The relation between <i>a</i> and the pre-emphasis frequency is: <i>a</i> = exp (&#8211;2&#183;<i></i>&#960;&#183;<i>preemphasisFrequency</i>/<i>samplingFrequency</i>). If you do not want pre-emphasis, choose a frequency greater than the <a href="Nyquist_frequency.html">Nyquist frequency</a>.
