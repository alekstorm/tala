Intro 1.1. Recording a sound
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
To record a speech sound into Praat, you need a computer with a microphone. If you do not have a microphone, try to record from an audio CD instead.</p>
<p>
To record from the microphone (or the CD), perform the following steps:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
1. Choose <a href="Record_mono_Sound___.html">Record mono Sound...</a> from the <a href="New_menu.html">New menu</a> in the <a href="Object_window.html">Object window</a>. A <a href="SoundRecorder.html">SoundRecorder</a> window will appear on your screen.
<dd>
2. In the SoundRecorder window, choose the appropriate input device, i.e. choose <b>Microphone</b> (or <b>CD</b>, or <b>Line</b>).
<dd>
3. Use the <b>Record</b> and <b>Stop</b> buttons to record a few seconds of your speech (or a few seconds of music from your playing CD).
<dd>
4. Use the <b>Play</b> button to hear what you have recorded.
<dd>
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you are satisfied with your recording.
<dd>
6. Click the <b>Save to list</b> button. Your recording will now appear in the Object window, where it will be called "Sound sound".
<dd>
7. You can now close the SoundRecorder window.
<dd>
8. When you saved your sound to the Object window, some buttons appeared in that window. These buttons show you what you can do with the sound. Try the <b>Play</b> and <a href="View___Edit.html">View & Edit</a> buttons.
