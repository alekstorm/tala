MAN_BEGIN (L"Programming with Praat", L"ppgb", 20110309)
INTRO (L"You can extend the functionality of the Praat program "
	"by adding modules written in C or C++ to it. All of Praat's source code "
	"is available under the General Public Licence.")
ENTRY (L"1. Warning")
NORMAL (L"Before trying the task of learning how to write Praat extensions in C or C++, "
	"you should be well aware of the possibilities of @scripting. "
	"Many built-in commands in Praat have started their "
	"lives as Praat scripts, and scripts are easier to write than extensions in C or C++. "
	"If you have a set of scripts, you can distribute them as a @@plug-ins|plug-in@.")
ENTRY (L"2. Getting the existing source code")
NORMAL (L"You obtain the Praat source code via ##www.praat.org#, in a file with a name like "
	"##praat5218_sources.tar.gz# (depending on the Praat version), and unpack this by double-clicking "
	"(on old computers, use #gunzip and ##tar xvf# if Unix, or ##StuffIt^\\re Expander^\\tm# if Macintosh, "
	"or ##Aladdin^\\re Expander^\\tm# if Windows). The result will be a set of directories "
	"called #kar, #GSL, #num, #audio (with #FLAC and #mp3 in it), #sys, #dwsys, #stat, #fon, #dwtools, #LPC, #FFNet, #gram, #artsynth, #contrib, #main, #makefiles, and #test, "
	"plus a makefile, a Codewarrior project for Windows, and an Xcode project for Macintosh.")
ENTRY (L"3. Building Praat on Macintosh")
NORMAL (L"Open ##praat.xcodeproj# in Xcode and choose #Build and #Run.")
ENTRY (L"4. Building Praat on Windows")
NORMAL (L"Open ##praat.mcp# in CodeWarrior (version 9.0 or higher), choose the target "
	"##praat_win#, and choose #Make or #Run.")
NORMAL (L"Praat may compile under MinGW as well.")
ENTRY (L"5. Building Praat on Linux")
NORMAL (L"To compile and link Praat on Linux, you go to the directory that "
	"contains the source directories and the makefile, and copy a ##makefile.defs# "
	"file from the #makefiles directory:")
CODE (L"> cp makefiles/makefile.defs.linux ./makefile.defs")
NORMAL (L"You have to have installed ##libgtk2.0-dev# (and its dependencies) and ##libasound2-dev#.")
NORMAL (L"On other Unixes, you do the same, but the file ##makefile.defs# may require some editing after this, "
	"because Silicon Graphics Irix, Sparc Solaris and HPUX may use different libraries or have them in different locations than Linux.")
ENTRY (L"6. Extending Praat")
NORMAL (L"You can edit ##main/main_Praat.cpp#. "
	"This example shows you how to create a very simple program with all the functionality "
	"of the Praat program, and a single bit more:")
CODE (L"\\# include \"praat.h\"")
CODE (L"")
CODE (L"DIRECT (HelloFromJane)")
CODE1 (L"Melder_information1 (L\"Hello, I am Jane.\");")
CODE (L"END")

CODE1 (L"praat_run ();")
CODE1 (L"return 0;")
CODE (L"}")
ENTRY (L"7. Learning how to program")
NORMAL (L"To see how objects are defined, take a look at ##sys/Thing.h#, ##sys/Data.h#, "
	"##sys/oo.h#, the ##XXX_def.h# files in the #fon directory, and the corresponding "
	"##XXX.c# and ##XXX.cpp# files in the #fon directory. To see how commands show up on the buttons "
	"in the fixed and dynamic menus, take a look at the large interface description file "
	"##fon/praat_Fon.cpp#.")
ENTRY (L"8. Using the Praat shell only")
NORMAL (L"For building the Praat shell (the Objects and Picture windows) only, you need only the code in the six directories "
	"#kar, #GSL, #num, #audio, #sys, and #dwsys. You delete the inclusion of praat_uvafon_init from #main. "
	"You will be able to build a Praat shell, i.e. an Objects and a Picture window, "
	"which has no knowledge of the world, i.e., which does not know any objects "
	"that can be included in the list of objects. You could use this Praat shell "
	"for modelling your own world and defining your own classes of objects. For advanced programmers only.")
