ENTRY (L"The source")

TAG (L"##Pitch")
DEFINITION (L"models fundamental frequency (in Hertz).")
TAG (L"##Flutter")
DEFINITION (L"models a kind of \"random\" variation of the pitch (with a number between zero and one). ")
TAG (L"##Voicing amplitude")
DEFINITION (L"models the maximum amplitude of the glottal flow (in dB SPL).")
TAG (L"##Open phase")
DEFINITION (L"models the open phase of the glottis (with a number between zero and one). If the tier is empty a default of 0.7 "
	"will be used.")
TAG (L"##Power1#, ##Power2#")
DEFINITION (L"model the form of the glottal flow function flow(%t)=%t^^%%power1%^-%t^^%%power2%^ for 0\\<_ t \\<_ 1. "
	"To make glottal closure possible, %power2 has to be larger than %power1. If the power1 tier is empty, a default "
	"value of 3 will be used. If the power2 tier is empty, a default of 4 will be used.")
TAG (L"##Collision phase")
DEFINITION (L"models the last part of the flow function with an exponential decay function instead of a polynomial one. "
	"More information about #Power1, #Power2, ##Open phase# and ##Collision phase# can be found in the @@PointProcess: To Sound (phonation)...@ manual.")
TAG (L"##Spectral tilt")

TAG (L"##Double pulsing")
DEFINITION (L"models diplophonia (by a fraction between zero and one). Whenever this parameter is greater than zero, "
	"alternate pulses are modified. A pulse is modified with this %%single% parameter in %%two% ways: it is %%delayed "
	"in time% and its amplitude is %%attenuated%.  If the double pulsing value is a maximum and equals one, the time of "
	"closure of the first peak coincides with the opening time of the second one. ")
ENTRY (L"The vocal tract filter")
NORMAL (L"The filter is modelled by a number of @@FormantGrid@'s. For parallel synthesis the formant grids that normally "

TAG (L"##Oral formants")
DEFINITION (L"represent the \"standard\" oral resonances of the vocal tract. ")
TAG (L"##Nasal formants")
DEFINITION (L"model resonances in the nasal tract. Because the form of the nasal tract does not vary much during the course of an utterance, nasal formants tend to be constant. ")
TAG (L"##Nasal antiformants")
DEFINITION (L"model dips in the spectrum caused by leakage to the nasal tract.")
ENTRY (L"Interaction between source and filter")
NORMAL (L"The interaction between source and filter is modeled by two formant grids.")
TAG (L"##Tracheal formants")
DEFINITION (L"model one aspect of the coupling of the trachea with the vocal tract transfer function, namely, by the "
	"introduction of extra formants (and antiformants) that sometimes distort vowel spectra to a varying degrees. "
	"According to @@Klatt & Klatt (1990)@, the other effect being increased losses at glottal termination which primarily affect first-formant bandwidths.")
TAG (L"##Tracheal antiformants")
DEFINITION (L"model dips in the spectrum caused by the trachea.")
TAG (L"##Delta formants")
DEFINITION (L"The values in this grid model the number of hertz that the oral formants and/or bandwidths change during the open phase "
	"of the glottis. @@Klatt & Klatt (1990)@ distinguish four types of source-filter interactions: an F1 ripple in the "
	"source waveform, a non-linear interaction between the first formant and the fundamental frequency, a truncation of "
	"the first formant and tracheal formants and antiformants. ")
ENTRY (L"The frication section")
NORMAL (L"The frication section is modeled with a frication formant grid, with formant frequencies, bandwidths and (separate) "
	"amplitudes (dB), a frication by-pass tier (dB) and an amplitude tier (dB SPL) that governs the frication noise source.")
ENTRY (L"A minimal synthesizer")

ENTRY (L"Changes")
NORMAL (L"In praat versions before 5.1.05 the values for the %%oral / nasal / tracheal formant amplitudes% and"

	" now they are in real dB's, i.e."
