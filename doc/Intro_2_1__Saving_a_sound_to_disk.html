Intro 2.1. Saving a sound to disk
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
There are several ways to write a sound to disk.</p>
<p>
First, the <a href="File_menu.html">File menu</a> of the <a href="SoundRecorder.html">SoundRecorder</a> window contains commands to save the left channel, the right channel, or both channels of the recorded sound to any of four standard types of sound files (WAV, AIFC, NeXT/Sun, NIST). These four file types are all equally good for Praat: Praat will handle them equally well on every computer. The first three of these types will also be recognized by nearly all other sound-playing programs.</p>
<p>
Then, once you have a <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> object in the <a href="List_of_Objects.html">List of Objects</a>, you can save it in several formats with the commands in the <a href="Save_menu.html">Save menu</a>. Again, the WAV, AIFF, AIFC, NeXT/Sun, and NIST formats are equally fine.</p>
<p>
