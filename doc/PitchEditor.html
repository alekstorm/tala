One of the <a href="Editors.html">Editors</a> in Praat, for viewing and modifying a <a href="Pitch.html">Pitch</a> object.</p>
<h3>
What the Pitch editor shows</h3>
<p>
In the window of the PitchEditor, you will see the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;Digits between 0 and 9 scattered all over the drawing area. Their locations represent the pitch <i><b>candidates</i></b>, of which there are several for every time frame. The digits themselves represent the goodness of a candidate, multiplied by ten. For instance, if you see a "9" at the location (1.23 seconds, 189 Hertz), this means that in the time frame at 1.23 seconds, there is a pitch candidate with a value of 189 Hertz, and its goodness is 0.9. The number 0.9 may be the relative height of an autocorrelation peak, a cross-correlation peak, or a spectral peak, depending on the method by which the Pitch object was computed.
<li>
&nbsp;A <i><b>path</i></b> of red disks. These disks represent the best path through the candidates, i.e. our best guess at what the pitch contour is. The path will usually have been determined by the <i>path finder</i>, which was called by the pitch-extraction algorithm, and you can change the path manually. The path finder takes into account the goodness of each candidate, the intensity of the sound in the frame, voiced-unvoiced transitions, and frequency jumps. It also determines whether each frame is voiced or unvoiced.
<li>
&nbsp;A <i><b>voicelessness bar</i></b> at the bottom of the drawing area. If there is no suitable pitch candidate in a frame, the frame is considered voiceless, which is shown as a blue rectangle in the voicelessness bar.
<li>
&nbsp;A line of digits between 0 and 9 along the top. These represent the relative intensity of the sound in each frame.
</ul>
<h3>
Moving the marks</h3>
<p>
To move the cursor hair or the beginning or end of the selection, use the <a href="time_selection.html">time selection</a> mechanism.</p>
<h3>
Changing the path</h3>
<p>
To change the path through the candidates manually, click on the candidates of your choice. The changes will immediately affect the Pitch object that you are editing. To make a voiced frame voiceless, click on the voicelessness bar.</p>
<p>
To change the path automatically, choose <b>Path finder...</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu; this will have the same effect as filling in different values in the <a href="Sound__To_Pitch__ac____.html">Sound: To Pitch (ac)...</a> dialog, but is much faster because the candidates do not have to be determined again.</p>
<h3>
Resynthesis</h3>
<p>
To hum any part of the pitch contour, click on one of the buttons below or above the data area (there can be 1 to 8 of these buttons), or use a <b>Play</b> command from the <b>View</b> menu.</p>
<h3>
Changing the ceiling</h3>
<p>
To change the ceiling, but not the path, choose <b>Change ceiling...</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu; if the new ceiling is lower than the old ceiling, some formerly voiced frames may become unvoiced; if the new ceiling is higher than the old ceiling, some formerly unvoiced frames may become voiced.</p>
