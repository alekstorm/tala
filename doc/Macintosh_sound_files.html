Macintosh sound files

<p>
A way for storing a <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> object on disk.</p>
<h3>
File format</h3>
<p>
The double-clickable sound file of the Macintosh (8 bits per sample). Cannot be ported to other machines, because the sound is in the <a href="Resource_fork.html">resource fork</a>.</p>
<h3>
Reading</h3>
<p>
With <a href="Read_from_file___.html">Read from file...</a>.</p>
<p>
To read a Sound from a Macintosh sound file on disk, use <a href="Read_from_file___.html">Read from file...</a> (Macintosh only).</p>
<p>
The 8-bit sample values are divided by 128 so that the amplitude of the resulting Sound is between &#8211;1.0 and +1.0.</p>
<p>
The resulting Sound will appear in the list of objects; its name will be equal to the file name, without extension.</p>
<h3>
Saving</h3>
<p>
With <b>Save as Mac sound file...</b>. Praat asks you for a file name. After you click OK, 0.5 is added to the samples of the Sound, they are multiplied by 128 and quantized between 0 and 255; the result is written to the file in 8-bit linear Macintosh sound-file format.</p>
<p>
To avoid clipping, keep the absolute amplitude below 1.000. If the maximum sound pressure level is 91 dB (top = 127), the quantization threshold for a sine wave is (top = 1/2) 43 dB.</p>
