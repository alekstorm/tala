KlattGrid: To Sound (special)...

<p>
A command to synthesize a Sound from the selected <a href="KlattGrid.html">KlattGrid</a>.</p>
<h3>
Settings</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Time range (s)</b>
<dd>
determines the part of the domain that you want to save as a sound. If both argument equal zero the complete sound is created. 
<dt>
<b>Sampling frequency (Hz)</b>
<dd>
determines the <a href="sampling_frequency.html">sampling frequency</a> of the resulting sound.
<dt>
<b>Scale peak</b>
<dd>
determines whether the peak value of the sound will be set to 0.99. In this way the sound will always play well and can be saved to a file with minimal loss of resolution.
<dt>
<b>Sampling frequency (Hz)</b>
<dd>
the <a href="sampling_frequency.html">sampling frequency</a> of the resulting sound.
<dt>
<b>Voicing</b>
<dd>
switches voicing on or off.
<dt>
<b>Flutter</b>
<dd>
switches the flutter tier on or off. This will, of course, only have effect if at least one flutter point has been defined in the flutter tier.
<dt>
<b>Double pulsing</b>
<dd>
switches the double pulsing tier on or off.
<dt>
<b>Collision phase</b>
<dd>
switches the collision phase tier on or off.
<dt>
<b>Spectral tilt</b>
<dd>
switches the spectral tilt tier on or off.
<dt>
<b>Flow function</b>
<dd>
determines which flow function will be used. The flow function is determined by two parameters, <i>power1</i> and <i>power2</i> as <i>flow(t)=x<sup>power1</sup>-x<sup>power2</sup></i>. If the option "Powers in tier" is chosen the power1 and power2 tiers will be used for the values of <i>power1</i> and <i>power2</i>. The other choices switch the two tiers off and instead fixed values will be used for <i>power1</i> and <i>power2</i>.
<dt>
<b>Flow derivative</b>
<dd>
determines whether the flow or the flow derivative is used for phonation. 
<dt>
<b>Aspiration</b>
<dd>
determines whether aspiration is included in the synthesis.
<dt>
<b>Breathiness</b>
<dd>
determines whether breathiness is included in the synthesis.
<dt>
<b>Model</b>
<dd>
switches on either the cascade or the parallel section of the synthesizer.
<dt>
<b>Oral formant range</b>, <b>Nasal formant range</b> ...
<dd>
selects the formants to use in the synthesis. Choosing the end of a range smaller than the start of the range switches off the formants. 
<dt>
<b>Frication bypass</b>
<dd>
switches the frication bypass of the frication section on or off. The complete frication section can be turned off by also switching off the frication formants.
