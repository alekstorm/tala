<p>
One of the commands in the <b>Edit</b> menu of the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a>.</p>
<p>
It erases your most recently created drawing, which could have come from a command in the Objects window or from one of the drawing commands in the World and <a href="Margins.html">Margins</a> menus.</p>
<h3>
Behaviour</h3>
<p>
This command will erase some drawings, but it will not change your settings in the <b>Pen</b> and <b>Font</b> menus (line type, line width, font, font size, and <a href="Colour.html">colour</a>).</p>
<p>
The world window will be what it was after the latest-but-one drawing, so that you can use the <a href="Margins.html">Margins</a> menu as if the latest drawing had never happened.</p>
