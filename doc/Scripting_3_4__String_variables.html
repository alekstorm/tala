Scripting 3.4. String variables
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
Just as you can store <a href="Scripting_3_2__Numeric_variables.html">numeric variables</a>, you can store <i>string variables</i>, which contain text instead of numbers. Here is an example:</p>
<code>
word1$ = "Hello"<br></code>
<code>
word2$ = "world"<br></code>
<code>
sentence$ = word1$ + " " + word2$<br></code>
<code>
echo The whole sentence is: 'sentence$'<br></code>
<p>
Yes, this is another way to get the sentence <code>Hello world</code> into the Info window. It's a more linguistically valid way to do it, and here is how it works:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
1. In line 1, the value "Hello", which is a text (as we can see by its use of quotes), is stored into the variable <code>word1$</code>, which is a string variable (as we can see because its name ends in a dollar sign).
<dd>
2. In line 2, the text value "world" is stored into the string variable <code>word2$</code>.
<dd>
3. In line 3, we have the formula <code>word1$ + " " + word2$</code>, which contains two variables, namely <code>word1$</code> and <code>word2$</code>.
<dd>
4. The values of the two variables are "Hello" and "world", respectively, so what the formula actually says is "Hello" + " " + "world".
<dd>
5. The pluses in the formula mean "concatenate", so we concatenate the three strings "Hello", " ", and "world", giving the longer string "Hello world".
<dd>
6. Still in line 3, the string value "Hello world" is assigned to the string variable <code>sentence$</code>.
<dd>
7. Line 4 reports in the Info window: <code>The whole sentence is: Hello world</code>
</dl>
