canonical variate

<p>
A <b>canonical variate</b> is a new variable (variate) formed by making a linear combination of two or more variates (variables) from a data set. A linear combination of variables is the same as a weighted sum of variables. Because we can in infinitely many ways choose combinations of weights between variables in a data set, there are also infinitely many canonical variates possible. </p>
<p>
In general additional constraints must be satisfied by the weights to get a meaningful canonical variate. For example, in <a href="Canonical_correlation_analysis.html">canonical correlation analyis</a> a data set is split up into two parts, a <i>dependent</i> and an <i>independent</i> part. In both parts we can form a canonical variate and we choose weights that maximize the correlation between these canonical variates (there is an <a href="TableOfReal__To_CCA___.html">algorithm</a> that calculates these weights).</p>
