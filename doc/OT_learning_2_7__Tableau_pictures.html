OT learning 2.7. Tableau pictures
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
To show a tableau in the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a> instead of in the editor, you select an <a href="OTGrammar.html">OTGrammar</a> object and click <b>Draw tableau...</b>. After you specify the input form, a tableau is drawn with the current font and size at the location of the current selection (<i>viewport</i>) in the Picture window. The top left corner of the tableau is aligned with the top left corner of the selection. You can draw more than one object into the Picture window, whose menus also allow you to add a lot of graphics of your own design.</p>
<p>
Besides printing the entire picture (with <a href="Print___.html">Print...</a>), you can save a part of it to an EPS file for inclusion into your favourite word processor (with <a href="Save_as_EPS_file___.html">Save as EPS file...</a>). For the latter to succeed, make sure that the selection includes at least your tableau; otherwise, some part of your tableau may end up truncated.</p>
