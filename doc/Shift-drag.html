<h3>
How to Shift-drag</h3>
<dl>
<dd>
1. Position the mouse above any of the objects that you want to drag (the objects were probably selected first).
<dd>
2. Press a Shift key.
<dd>
3. Press the (left) mouse button.
<dd>
4. Keeping the mouse button pressed, move the mouse across the window. A shadow of the objects will follow.
<dd>
5. Release the mouse button when it is above the location where you want your objects to be moved. If this <i>drop site</i> makes any sense, the objects will move there.

<h3>
Usage in the Praat program</h3>
<p>
While plain <a href="Drag.html">drag</a>ging is used for moving objects that were selected first by clicking, <b>Shift-dragging</b> is used for manipulating the times and values of more marks, targets, or boundaries simultaneously:</p>
