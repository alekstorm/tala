NORMAL (L"We are going to have the synthesizer say [\\swp\\sw]. We need a @Speaker and an @Artword object.")
NORMAL (L"1. Create a speaker with @@Create Speaker...@ from the @@New menu@.")

NORMAL (L"3. Edit the Artword by selecting it and clicking ##View & Edit#.")
NORMAL (L"4. To set the glottis to a position suitable for phonation, use the ArtwordEditor to "
	"set the %Interarytenoid activity to 0.5 throughout the utterance. You set two targets: "
	"0.5 at a time of 0 seconds, and 0.5 at a time of 0.5 seconds.")
NORMAL (L"5. To prevent air escaping from the nose, close the nasopharyngeal port "
	"by setting the %LevatorPalatini activity to 1.0 throughout the utterance.")

ENTRY (L"Settings")
TAG (L"##Sampling frequency (Hz)")
DEFINITION (L"the number of times per second that the equilibrium widths and lengths and the tensions of the muscles "
	"are recomputed from the Artword. This will also be the sampling frequency of the resulting sound and "
	"of the optional resulting tube widths, air pressures, and air velocities. The standard value is 22050 Hz.")

DEFINITION (L"the number of times that the aerodynamic quantities and the state of the tube walls "

TAG (L"##Width 1#, ##Width 2#, ##Width 3#")
DEFINITION (L"the numbers (see below) of the tubes whose widths you want to monitor. "
	"E.g., if ##Width 1# is 36, the synthesizer will create a Sound object named $$width36$, "
	"which contains the width of tube 36 (the lower glottis) as a function of time, expressed in metres. "
	"To prevent the creation of a $$width$ object, specify $$0$ (the standard value).")
TAG (L"##Pressure 1#, ##Pressure 2#, ##Pressure 3#")
DEFINITION (L"the numbers (see below) of the tubes whose air pressures you want to monitor. "
	"E.g., if ##Pressure 3# is 37, the synthesizer will create a Sound object named $$pressure37$, "
	"which contains the air pressure of tube 37 (the upper glottis) as a function of time, expressed in Pascal. "
	"To prevent the creation of a $$pressure$ object, specify $$0$ (the standard value).")
TAG (L"##Velocity 1#, ##Velocity 2#, ##Velocity 3")
DEFINITION (L"the numbers (see below) of the tubes whose air velocities you want to monitor. "
	"E.g., if ##Velocity 1# is 60, the synthesizer will create a Sound object named $velocity60, "
	"which contains the air velocity of tube 60 (in the mouth) as a function of time, expressed in metres per second. "
	"To prevent the creation of a $velocity object, specify $0 (the standard value).")
ENTRY (L"Stability")
NORMAL (L"The internal sampling frequency for the aerodynamics is the specified ##Sampling frequency#, "
	"multiplied by the specified #Oversampling. With the standard settings, this is 22050 times 25 = 550750 Hz.")
NORMAL (L"To ensure the stability of the synthesis, this internal sampling frequency should not be less than the "
	"velocity of sound (353 m/s) divided by the length of the shortest tube. For the standard #Female, "
	"#Male, and #Child speakers, the shortest tube is the upper glottis, which has a length "
	"of 0.7, 1.0, and 0.3 millimetres, respectively. The minimum internal sampling frequencies, therefore, "
	"are 504286, 353000, and 1176667 Hertz, respectively.")
ENTRY (L"Time resolution")
