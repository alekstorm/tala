<p>
With some commands in the <a href="New_menu.html">New menu</a>, you can supply a formula that Praat will apply to all elements of the new object.</p>
<h3>
Creating a Sound from a formula</h3>
<p>
Choose <a href="Create_Sound_from_formula___.html">Create Sound from formula...</a> and type the following into the <b><i>Formula</i></b> field:</p>
<code>
1/2 * sin (2 * pi * 377 * x)<br></code>
<p>
When you click OK, a new <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> object will appear in the list. After you click <b>View &amp; Edit</b> and zoom in a couple of times, you will see that the sound is a sine wave with a frequency of 377 Hertz (cycles per second). This worked because the <i>x</i> in the formula represents the time, i.e. the formula was applied to every sample separately, with a different value of <i>x</i> for each sample.</p>
<h3>
Creating a Matrix from a formula</h3>
<p>
Choose <a href="Create_simple_Matrix___.html">Create simple Matrix...</a> and type the following into the <b><i>Formula</i></b> field:</p>
<code>
8<br></code>
<p>
When you click OK, a new <a href="Matrix.html">Matrix</a> object will appear in the list. When you click <b>Info</b>, you will see that it is a matrix with 10 rows and 10 columns, and that all the 100 cells contain the value 8 (you can see this because both the minimum and the maximum are reported as being 8).</p>
<p>
A more interesting example is the formula</p>
<code>
row * col<br></code>
<p>
For the resulting Matrix, choose <a href="Matrix__Paint_cells___.html">Paint cells...</a> and click OK. The Picture window will show a 10&#215;10 matrix whose elements are the product of the row and column numbers, i.e., they have values between 1 and 100. Beside <i>row</i> and <i>col</i>, you can use <i>x</i> for the distance along the horizontal axis and <i>y</i> for the distance along the vertical axis; see the following page for examples.</p>
