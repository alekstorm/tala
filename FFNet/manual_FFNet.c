INTRO (L"A feedforward neural network is a biologically inspired classification algorithm. "
	"It consist of a (possibly large) number of simple neuron-like processing %units, organized in %layers. "
	"Every unit in a layer is connected with all the units in the previous layer. "
	"These connections are not all equal, each connection may have a different strength or %weight. "
	"The weights on these connections encode the knowledge of a network. "
	"Often the units in a neural network are also called %nodes.")
NORMAL (L"Data enters at the inputs and passes through the network, layer by layer, until it arrives at the outputs. "
	"During normal operation, that is when it acts as a classifier, there is no feedback between layers. "
	"This is why they are called %%feedforward% neural networks. ")

	"an output layer with 5 units, a %hidden layer with 4 units, respectively. The network has 3 input units.")

	"All weights are modified in such a way that when a pattern is presented, "
	"the output unit with the correct category, hopefully, will have the largest output value.")
ENTRY (L"How does learning take place?")
NORMAL (L"The FFNet uses a %supervised learning algorithm: besides the input pattern, "
	"the neural net also needs to know to what category the pattern belongs. "
	"Learning proceeds as follows: a pattern is presented at the inputs. "
	"The pattern will be transformed in its passage through the layers of the network until it "
	"reaches the output layer. The units in the output layer all belong to a different category. "
	"The outputs of the network as they are now are compared with the outputs as they ideally would "
	"have been if this pattern were correctly classified: in the latter case "
	"the unit with the correct category would have had the largest output value and the "
	"output values of the other output units would have been very small. "
	"On the basis of this comparison all the connection weights are modified a little bit to guarantee that, the next time "
	"this same pattern is presented at the inputs, the value of the output unit that corresponds with the correct category "
	"is a little bit higher than it is now and that, at the same time, the output values of all the other incorrect outputs are a "
	"little bit lower than they are now. (The differences between the actual outputs and the idealized outputs "
	"are propagated back from the top layer to lower layers to be used at these layers to modify connection weights. "
	"This is why the term %%backpropagation network% is also often used to describe this type of neural network.")

ENTRY (L"How long will the learning phase take?")

	"and the speed of your computer, how much computing time the learning phase may take. ")
