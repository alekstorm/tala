<h3>
Praat 3.3, 6 October 1996</h3>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;Documentation: hypertext help browser, including the first 190 man pages.
<li>
&nbsp;New editors: class <b>TextTier</b> for labelling times instead of intervals.
<li>
&nbsp;New actions: <b>Formant</b>: Viterbi tracker, Statistics menu, Scatter plot.
<li>
&nbsp;Evaluation: For HNR analysis of speech, the cross-correlation method, which has a sensitivity of 60 dB and a typical time resolution of 12 milliseconds, must be considered better than the autocorrelation method, which has a better sensitivity (80 dB), but a much worse time resolution (30 ms). For pitch analysis, the autocorrelation method still beats the cross-correlation method because of its better resistance against noise and echos, and despite its marginally poorer resolution (15 vs. 12 ms).
<li>
&nbsp;User preferences are saved across sessions.
<li>
&nbsp;The phonetic X screen font included in the source code.
<li>
&nbsp;Xwindows resources included in the source code
<li>
&nbsp;Graphics: eight colours, small caps, text rotation.
<li>
&nbsp;File formats: Sun/NexT mu-law files, raw matrix text files, Xwaves mark files.
<li>
&nbsp;Accelerations: keyboard shortcuts, faster dynamic menu, Shift-OK keeps file selector on screen.
<li>
&nbsp;Class changes: <b>StylPitch</b> and <b>MarkTier</b> are now called <b>PitchTier</b> and <b>TextTier</b>, respectively. Old files can still be read.
<li>
&nbsp;Script warning: all times in dialogs are in seconds now: milliseconds have gone.
</ul>
