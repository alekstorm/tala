<p>
Air pressures are measured in Pascal (Pa), which are Newtons per square metre (N/m<sup>2</sup>). The ambient air pressure is about 100,000 Pa, and the lungs modify this in phonation only by a small amount, namely 200 to 1000 Pa (= 2 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). Outside your body, the air pressures caused by your speech are much smaller again, namely 0.01 to 1 Pa at 1 metre from your lips. These are comparable to the values that you see for a typical speech recording in Praat's sound window, although these numbers in Praat can be interpreted as true air pressures only if you perform a <a href="sound_pressure_calibration.html">sound pressure calibration</a> (including the multiplication).</p>
<p>
A normative human ear can detect a root-mean-squared air pressure as small as 0.00002 Pa, for a sine wave with a frequency of 1000 Hz. The <i>sound pressure level</i> can be expressed in dB relative to this normative threshold:</p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td align=middle>
SPL = 10 log<sub>10</sub> { 1/(<i>t</i><sub>2</sub>-<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>) &#8747;<sub>t1</sub><sup>t2</sup> <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>(<i>t</i>) <i>dt</i> / (2&#183;10<sup>-5</sup> Pa)<sup>2</sup> }</table>
<p>
where <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) is the sound pressure in Pa as a function of time, and <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> are the times between which the energy (squared air pressure) is averaged. For a calibrated sound, Praat's sound window will show you the SPL as a function of time, if you switch on <b>Show intensity</b> and set its <b>averaging method</b> to <b>energy</b> (with <b>Intensity settings...</b>).</p>
