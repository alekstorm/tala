<p>
One of the <a href="Editors.html">Editors</a> in Praat, for viewing and manipulating a <a href="Manipulation.html">Manipulation</a> object.</p>
<h3>
Objects</h3>
<p>
The editor shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;The original <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a>.
<li>
&nbsp;The <a href="PointProcess.html">PointProcess</a> that represents the glottal <i>pulses</i>. You can edit it for improving the pitch analysis.
<li>
&nbsp;A pitch contour based on the locations of the pulses, for comparison (drawn as grey dots). Changes shape if you edit the pulses.
<li>
&nbsp;The <a href="PitchTier.html">PitchTier</a> that determines the pitch contour of the resynthesized <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> (drawn as blue circles). At the creation of the <a href="Manipulation.html">Manipulation</a> object, it is computed from the original pitch contour. You can manipulate it by simplifying it (i.e., removing targets), or by moving parts of it up and down, and back and forth.
<li>
&nbsp;A <a href="DurationTier.html">DurationTier</a> for manipulating the relative durations of the voiced parts of the sound.
</ul>
<h3>
Playing</h3>
<p>
To play (a part of) the <i>resynthesized</i> sound (by any of the methods shown in the <b>Synth</b> menu, like <a href="overlap-add.html">overlap-add</a> and <b>LPC</b>), <a href="Click.html">click</a> on any of the 1 to 8 buttons below and above the drawing area or use the Play commands from the View menu.</p>
<p>
To play the <i>original</i> sound instead, use <b>Shift-click</b>.</p>
<h3>
Pulses</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
To add:
<dd>
<b>click</b> at the desired time location, and choose <b>Add pulse at cursor</b> or type <b>Command-p</b>.
<dt>
To remove:
<dd>
make a <a href="time_selection.html">time selection</a>, and choose <b>Remove pulse(s)</b> or type <b>Option-Command-p</b>. If there is no selection, the pulse nearest to the cursor is removed.
</dl>
<h3>
Pitch points</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
To add one at a specified <i>time and frequency</i>:
<dd>
<b>click</b> at the desired time-frequency location, and choose <b>Add pitch point at cursor</b> or type <b>Command-t</b>.
<dt>
To add one at a specified <i>time</i> only:
<dd>
<b>click</b> at the desired time, and choose <b>Add pitch point at time slice</b>. ManipulationEditor tries to compute the frequency from the intervals between the pulses, basically by a median-of-three method.
<dt>
To remove:
<dd>
make a <a href="time_selection.html">time selection</a>, and choose <b>Remove pitch point(s)</b> or type <b>Option-Command-t</b>. If there is no selection, the pitch point nearest to the cursor is removed.
<dt>
To move <i>some</i>:
<dd>
make a <a href="time_selection.html">time selection</a> (the points become red) and <b>Shift-drag</b> the points across the window. You cannot drag them across adjacent points, or below 50 Hz, or above the maximum frequency. You can only drag them horizontally if the <i>dragging strategy</i> is <b>All</b> or <b>Only horizontal</b>, and you can drag them vertically if the dragging strategy is not <b>Only horizontal</b>. You can change the dragging strategy with <b>Set pitch dragging strategy...</b> from the <b>Pitch</b> menu.
<dt>
To move <i>one</i>:
<dd>
<a href="Drag.html">drag</a> that point across the window. You can only drag it horizontally if the dragging strategy is not <b>Only vertical</b>, and you can drag it vertically if the dragging strategy is not <b>Only horizontal</b>.
</dl>
<h3>
Duration points</h3>
<p>
Work pretty much the same as pitch points.</p>
<h3>
Stylization</h3>
<p>
Before editing the Pitch points, you may want to reduce their number by choosing any of the <b>Stylize</b> commands from the <b>Pitch</b> menu.</p>
