Sound: Scale peak...

<p>
A command available in the <b>Modify</b> menu when you select one or more <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> objects. With this command you multiply the amplitude of each Sound in such a way that its absolute peak becomes the <b>new absolute peak</b> that you specify (see Settings).</p>
<h3>
Settings</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>New absolute peak</b>
<dd>
the new absolute peak of the Sound. The standard value is 0.99: this maximizes the audibility of the Sound (sounds with lower amplitude are weaker) without distorting it (sounds with absolute peaks above 1 are clipped when they are played).
</dl>
<h3>
Examples</h3>
<p>
The absolute peak of the following sound is 0.033:</p>
<p>
Create Sound from formula... 033 mono 0 0.1 10000 -0.02*(sin(2*pi*205*x)+sin(2*pi*5*x))+0.007
Draw... 0 0 -0.033 0.0247 yes curve
Remove</p>
<p>
This sound will play rather weakly. To make it louder, you can do <b>Scale peak...</b> with a <b>new absolute peak</b> of 0.99. Praat will then multiply the waveform by 30, changing the sound to the following:</p>
<p>
Create Sound from formula... 033 mono 0 0.1 10000 -0.6*(sin(2*pi*205*x)+sin(2*pi*5*x))+0.21
Draw... 0 0 -0.99 0.741 yes curve
Remove</p>
<p>
The absolute peak is now 0.99, and the sound will play loudly.</p>
<p>
The reverse is also possible. The absolute peak of the following sound is 19.8:</p>
<p>
Create Sound from formula... 033 mono 0 0.1 10000 12*(sin(2*pi*305*x)+sin(2*pi*5*x))-4.2
Draw... 0 0 -15.28 19.8 yes curve
Remove</p>
<p>
This sound will not play correctly: all samples with an amplitude outside the [-1;+1] range will be clipped to -1 or +1. To make this sound nicer to play, you can again do <b>Scale peak...</b> with a <b>new absolute peak</b> of 0.99. Praat will then divide the waveform by 20, changing the sound to the following:</p>
<p>
Create Sound from formula... 033 mono 0 0.1 10000 0.6*(sin(2*pi*305*x)+sin(2*pi*5*x))-0.21
Draw... 0 0 -0.764 0.99 yes curve
Remove</p>
<p>
The absolute peak is now 0.99, and the sound will play without distortion.</p>
