Intro 8.1. Manipulation of pitch
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
To modify the pitch contour of an existing <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> object, you select this <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> and click <b>To Manipulation</b>. A <a href="Manipulation.html">Manipulation</a> object will then appear in the list. You can then click <a href="View___Edit.html">View & Edit</a> to raise a <a href="ManipulationEditor.html">ManipulationEditor</a>, which will show the pitch contour (<a href="PitchTier.html">PitchTier</a>) as a series of thick dots. To reduce the number of dots, choose <b>Stylize pitch (2 st)</b> from the <b>Pitch</b> menu; it will then be easy to drag the dots about the time-pitch area.</p>
<p>
If you click any of the rectangles (or choose any of the <b>Play</b> commands from the <b>View</b> menu), you will hear the modified sound. By shift-clicking, you will hear the original sound.</p>
<p>
To get the modified sound as a separate object, choose <b>Publish resynthesis</b> from the <a href="File_menu.html">File menu</a>.</p>
<p>
If you modify the duration curve as well (see <a href="Intro_8_2__Manipulation_of_duration.html">Intro 8.2. Manipulation of duration</a>), the modified sound will be based on the modified pitch and duration.</p>
<h3>
Cloning a pitch contour</h3>
<p>
To use the pitch contour of one Manipulation object as the pitch contour of another Manipulation object, you first choose <b>Extract pitch tier</b> for the first Manipulation object, then select the resulting PitchTier object together with the other Manipulation object (e.g. by a click on the PitchTier and a Command-click on the Manipulation), and choose <b>Replace pitch tier</b>.</p>
<h3>
Precise manipulation of pitch</h3>
<p>
If you know exactly what pitch contour you want, you can create an empty PitchTier with <a href="Create_PitchTier___.html">Create PitchTier...</a> from the New menu, then add points with <a href="PitchTier__Add_point___.html">PitchTier: Add point...</a>.</p>
<p>
For instance, suppose you want to have a pitch that falls from 350 to 150 Hz in one second. You create the PitchTier, then add a point at 0 seconds and a frequency of 350 Hz, and a point at 1 second with a frequency of 150 Hz. You can put this PitchTier into a Manipulation object in the way described above.</p>
