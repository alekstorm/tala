Intro 4.2. Configuring the pitch contour
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
With <a href="Pitch_settings___.html">Pitch settings...</a> from the <b>Pitch</b> menu, you can determine how the pitch contour is displayed and how it is computed. These settings will be remembered across Praat sessions. All these settings have standard values ("factory settings"), which appear when you click <b>Standards</b>.</p>
<h3>
The <i>pitch range</i> setting</h3>
<p>
This is the most important setting for pitch analysis. The standard range is from 75 to 500 Hertz, which means that the pitch analysis method will only find values between 75 and 500 Hz. The range that you set here will be shown to the right of the analysis window.</p>
<p>
For a male voice, you may want to set the floor to 75 Hz, and the ceiling to 300 Hz; for a female voice, set the range to 100-500 Hz instead. For creaky voice you will want to set it much lower than 75 Hz.</p>
<p>
Here is why you have to supply these settings. If the pitch floor is 75 Hz, the pitch analysis method requires a 40-millisecond analysis window, i.e., in order to measure the F0 at a time of, say, 0.850 seconds, Praat needs to consider a part of the sound that runs from 0.830 to 0.870 seconds. These 40 milliseconds correspond to 3 maximum pitch periods (3/75 = 0.040). If you set the pitch floor down to 25 Hz, the analysis window will grow to 120 milliseconds (which is again 3 maximum pitch periods), i.e., all times between 0.790 and 0.910 seconds will be considered. This makes it less easy to see fast F0 changes.</p>
<p>
So setting the floor of the pitch range is a technical requirement for the pitch analysis. If you set it too low, you will miss very fast F0 changes, and if you set it too high, you will miss very low F0 values. For children's voices you can often use 200 Hz, although 75 Hz will still give you the same time resolution as you get for the males.</p>
<h3>
The <i>units</i> setting</h3>
<p>
This setting determines the units of the vertical pitch scale. Most people like to see the pitch range in Hertz, but there are several other possibilities.</p>

The Pitch menu also contains <a href="Advanced_pitch_settings___.html">Advanced pitch settings...</a>.</p>
