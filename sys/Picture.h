/* A self-recording picture inside a Motif DrawingArea widget.
	All drawing is kept in a Graphics.
	If the picture is sensitive,
	the user can select the viewport by dragging the mouse across the drawing area.
	If the viewport is smaller than the entire drawing area, it is highlighted.
	Usage:
		You should put highlighting off during drawing.
		Do not use the workstation Graphics routines,
		like clearWs, flushWs, closeWs, updateWs, setWsViewport.
	Example:
		Picture p = Picture_create (myDrawingArea);
		Any g = Picture_getGraphics (p);
		Picture_unhighlight (p);
		Graphics_setTextAlignment (g, Graphics_CENTRE, Graphics_HALF);
		Graphics_text (g, 0.5, 0.7, L"Hello");
		Graphics_text (g, 0.5, 0.6, L"there");
		Picture_highlight (p);
		... (event handling)
		Picture_unhighlight (p);
		Graphics_text (g, 0.5, 0.3, L"Goodbye");
		Picture_highlight (p);
		... (event handling)
		Picture_writeToPostscriptFile (p, L"HelloGoodbye.ps");
		Picture_print (p, GraphicsPostscript_FINE);
		Picture_remove (& p);
