Sound: To Pitch (cc)...
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
A command that creates a <a href="Pitch.html">Pitch</a> object from every selected <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> object.</p>
<h3>
Purpose</h3>
<p>
to perform a pitch analysis based on a cross-correlation method.</p>
<h3>
Algorithm</h3>
<p>
The algorithm performs an acoustic periodicity detection on the basis of a forward cross-correlation analysis.</p>
<h3>
Settings</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Time step (s)</b> (standard value: 0.0)
<dd>
the measurement interval (frame duration), in seconds. If you supply 0, Praat will use a time step of 0.25 / (<i>pitch floor</i>), e.g. 0.00333333 seconds if the pitch floor is 75 Hz; in this example, Praat computes 300 pitch values per second.
<dt>
<b>Pitch floor (Hz)</b> (standard value: 75 Hz)
<dd>
candidates below this frequency will not be recruited. This parameter determines the length of the analysis window: it will be 1 longest period long, i.e., if the pitch floor is 75 Hz, the window will be 1/75 = 0.01333333 seconds long.
</dl>
<p>
Note that if you set the time step to zero, the analysis windows for consecutive measurements will overlap appreciably: Praat will always compute 4 pitch values within one window length, i.e., the degree of <i>oversampling</i> is 4.</p>
<p>
The other settings are the same as for <a href="Sound__To_Pitch__ac____.html">Sound: To Pitch (ac)...</a>.</p>
<h3>
Usage</h3>
<p>
The preferred method for speech is <a href="Sound__To_Pitch___.html">Sound: To Pitch...</a>. The command described here is mainly for experimenting, or for applications where you need short time windows.</p>
