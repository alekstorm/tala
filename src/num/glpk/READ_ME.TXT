Praats/num/glpk/READ_ME.TXT
Paul Boersma, 26 June 2010
This file describes the adaptations to the glpk 4.44 sources
that are needed to make them compatible with Praat.

The .c and .h files are put into the single glpk directory.

The #include statements are flattened, e.g.
#include amd/amd.h becomes #include amd.h.

The redefinition of SIZE_T_MAX in amd_internal.h is ifndef'ed out.

In glpios09.c, char is changed to unsigned char in line 197.

GLPK is a heavy namespace polluter.
Because of a name clash with the C library in CodeWarrior
("error" is a member of the FILE structure),
I replaced the "error" macro with "mpl_error" in all glpmpl* files.

Description:

   AMD is a set of routines for pre-ordering sparse matrices prior to
   Cholesky or LU factorization, using the approximate minimum degree
   ordering algorithm.  Written in ANSI/ISO C with a MATLAB interface,
   and in Fortran 77.

COLAMD/SYMAMD Version 2.7, Copyright (C) 1998-2007, Timothy A. Davis,

Description:

   colamd:  an approximate minimum degree column ordering algorithm,
            for LU factorization of symmetric or unsymmetric matrices,
            QR factorization, least squares, interior point methods for
            linear programming problems, and other related problems.

   symamd:  an approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm for
            Cholesky factorization of symmetric matrices.

Purpose:

   Colamd computes a permutation Q such that the Cholesky factorization
   of (AQ)'(AQ) has less fill-in and requires fewer floating point
   operations than A'A.  This also provides a good ordering for sparse
   partial pivoting methods, P(AQ) = LU, where Q is computed prior to
   numerical factorization, and P is computed during numerical
   factorization via conventional partial pivoting with row
   interchanges.  Colamd is the column ordering method used in SuperLU,
   part of the ScaLAPACK library.  It is also available as built-in
   function in MATLAB Version 6, available from MathWorks, Inc.
   (http://www.mathworks.com).  This routine can be used in place of
   colmmd in MATLAB.

   Symamd computes a permutation P of a symmetric matrix A such that
   the Cholesky factorization of PAP' has less fill-in and requires
   fewer floating point operations than A.  Symamd constructs a matrix
   M such that M'M has the same nonzero pattern of A, and then orders
   the columns of M using colmmd.  The column ordering of M is then
   returned as the row and column ordering P of A.

Authors:

   The authors of the code itself are Stefan I. Larimore and Timothy A.
   Davis (davis at cise.ufl.edu), University of Florida.  The algorithm
   was developed in collaboration with John Gilbert, Xerox PARC, and
   Esmond Ng, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
