	There are two types of TIMIT label files. One with phonetic labels, these
	files have '.phn' as file extension. The other contains word labels and has
	'.wrd' as extension. Since these extensions are only valid on the CDROM we can
	not use them for filetype recognition. Both TIMIT label files do not have a 
	self-describing format. For filetype recognition we make use of the fact that
	both files are text files and always have three items on each line: two numbers
	followed by a string. The numbers increase in a monotone way.
	The recognizer only checks the first two lines and it tests whether
		0 <= number[1] < number[2] <= number[3] < number[4]
	(A number of .wrd files do not obey the monotonocity constraint for
	 number[4] and number[5] !)
	The decision whether it is a .phn or .wrd file is:
		.phn if string[1] == 'h#' AND string[2] is a TIMIT phonetic label
		.wrd if (string[1] == 'h#' AND string[2] is a valid word) OR
			string[1] and string[2] are both valid words.
		A valid word is a string with contains the lowercase characters [a-z] and ['].
