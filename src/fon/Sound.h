 * Play a sound. The playing can be interrupted with the Escape key (also Command-period on the Mac).
 * If playCallback is not NULL, Sound_play will call it repeatedly, with five parameters:
 *    1. playClosure: the same value as was supplied as the last argument to Sound_playPart.
 *    2. phase: 1 at the start, 2 while playing, 3 at the end.
 *    3. tmin: the same tmin that was supplied as the second argument to Sound_playPart.
 *    4. tmax: the same tmax that was supplied as the second argument to Sound_playPart.
 *    5. t: the time (probably between tmin and tmax) at which the sound is playing.
 * The usage of playCallback is as follows. Suppose we are an editor that wants to show a moving
 * cursor while we play a sound:
 *    Sound_playPart (my sound, my startSelection, my endSelection, thePlayCallback, me);
 * We gave ourselves as the playClosure, so that the message will arrive with us:
 *    int thePlayCallback (void *playClosure, int phase, double tmin, double tmax, double t) {
 *       SoundEditor me = (SoundEditor) playClosure;
 *       if (phase == 1) {
 *          Melder_assert (t == tmin);
 *          drawPlayCursor (me, my playCursor = t);
 *       } else if (phase == 2) {
 *          undrawPlayCursor (me, my playCursor);
 *          drawPlayCursor (me, my playCursor = t);
 *       } else {
 *          undrawPlayCursor (me, t);
 *          moveCursor (me, t);
 *          if (t < tmax) { Melder_casual ("Sound play interrupted."); }
 *       }
 *       return 1;
 *    }
 * The playCallback procedure usually returns 1, because the sound should continue playing.
 * If playCallback returns 0 instead, Sound_play will interrupt the play and return.
 * Sound_playPart returns the time at which playing stopped. If playing was not interrupted, it returns tmax.
 *
 * Sound_playPart () usually runs asynchronously, and kills an already playing sound.
