DTW: Get y time...

<p>
Queries the selected <a href="DTW.html">DTW</a> object for the time along the <i>y</i>-direction given the time along the "<i>x</i>-direction". </p>
<h3>
Setting</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Time (s)</b>
<dd>
the time along the <i>x</i>-direction.
</dl>
<h3>
Behaviour</h3>
<p>
When the <i>input</i> time is in the interval [<i>xmin</i>, <i>xmax</i>], the <i>returned</i> time will be in the interval [<i>ymin</i>, <i>ymax</i>], where [<i>xmin</i>, <i>xmax</i>] and [<i>ymin</i>, <i>ymax</i>] are the domains of the two "objects" from which the DTW-object was constructed.For input times outside the domain we assume that the two object were aligned.</p>
<p>
We like to have a "continuous" interpretation of time for the quantized times in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> direction; we make the path a piecewise linear monotonically increasing function. There are special cases:</p>
<p>
1. The local path is in the <i>x</i>-direction only. We calculate the <i>y</i>-time from the line that connects the lower-left position of the begin cell of this path to the upper-right position of the last cell.</p>
<p>
2. The local path is in the x-direction only. We calculate the <i>y</i>-time from the line that connects the lower-left position of lowest cell to the upper-right position of the highest cell.</p>
<p>
3. A cell is both part of a path in the <i>x</i>- and the <i>y</i>-direction. We then calculate the intersection point of the paths in the <i>x</i>- and the <i>y</i>-directions. The <i>y</i>-times in this cell are now calculated from the two line segments that originate from this intersection point.</p>
