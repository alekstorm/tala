Sound: To Sound (blind source separation)...
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
Analyze the selected multi-channel sound into its independent components by an iterative method.</p>
<p>
The method to find the independent components tries to simultaneously diagonalize a number of <a href="CrossCorrelationTable.html">CrossCorrelationTable</a>s that are calculated from the multi-channel sound at different lag times.</p>

<h3>
Algorithm</h3>
<p>
This method tries to decompose the sound according to the <i>instantaneous</i> mixing model</p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td align=middle>
<b>Y</b>=<b>A</b>&#183;<b>X</b>.</table>
<p>
In this model <b>Y</b> is a matrix with the selected multi-channel sound, <b>A</b> is a so-called <i>mixing matrix</i> and <b>X</b> is a matrix with the independent components. Essentially the model says that each channel in the multi-channel sound is a linear combination of the independent sound components in <b>X</b>. If we would know the mixing matrix <b>A</b> we could easily solve the model above for <b>X</b> by standard means. However, if we don't know <b>A</b> and we don't know <b>X</b>, the decomposition of <b>Y</b> is underdetermined as there are an infinite number of possibilities. </p>
<p>
One approach to solve the equation above is to make assumptions about the statistical properties of the components in the matrix <b>X</b>: it turns out that a sufficient assumption is to assume that the components in <b>X</b> at each time instant are <i>statistically independent</i>. This is not an unrealistic assumption in many cases, although in practice it need not be exactly the case. Another assumption is that the mixing matrix is constant.</p>
<p>
The theory says that statistically independent signals are not correlated (although the reverse is not always true: signals that are not correlated don't have to be statistically independent). The methods implemented here all follow this lead as follows. If we calculate the <a href="CrossCorrelationTable.html">CrossCorrelationTable</a> for the left and the right side signals of the equation above, then, for the multi-channel sound <b>Y</b> this will result in a cross-correlation matrix <b>C</b>. For the right side we obtain <b>A</b>&#183;<b>D</b>&#183;<b>A</b>&#8242;, where <b>D</b> is a diagonal matrix because all the cross-correlations between different independent components are zero by definition. This results in the following identity: </p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td align=middle>
<b>C</b>(&#964;)=<b>A</b>&#183;<b>D</b>(&#964;)&#183;<b>A</b>&#8242;, for all values of the lag time &#964;.</table>
<p>
This equation says that, given the model, the cross-correlation matrix can be diagonalized for all values of the lag time <i>by the same transformation matrix</i> <b>A</b>.</p>
<p>
If we calculate the cross-correlation matrices for a number of different lag times, say 20, we then have to obtain the matrix <b>A</b> that diagonalizes them all. Unfortunately there is no closed form solution that diagonalizes more than two matrices at the same time and we have to resort to iterative algorithms for joint diagonalization. </p>
<p>
Two of these algorithms are the <b>qdiag</b> method as described in <a href="Vollgraf___Obermayer__2006_.html">Vollgraf & Obermayer (2006)</a> and the <b>ffdiag</b> method as described in <a href="Ziehe_et_al___2004_.html">Ziehe et al. (2004)</a>. </p>
<p>
Unfortunately the convergence criteria of these two algorithms cannot easily be compared as the criterion for the <b>ffdiag</b> algorithm is the relative change of the square root of the sum of the squared off-diagonal elements of the transformed cross-correlation matrices and the criterion for <b>qdiag</b> is the largest change in the eigenvectors norm during an iteration.</p>
