Scripting 3.3. Numeric queries

<p>
Now that you know how to script a menu command, and you know how variables work, you are ready to combine the two.</p>
<p>
Suppose you have selected a Sound in the object list. One of the commands available in the <b>Query</b> menu is <b>Get power...</b>. To get the mean power of the whole Sound, you can try the script</p>
<code>
Get power... 0 0<br></code>
<p>
This works, and it puts the text <code>0.1350605005239421 Pa2</code> or so into the Info window.</p>
<p>
Often though, you will want to use this value in the script itself, perhaps for doing computations with it or for reporting it with a nice text around it. This is how you do it:</p>
<code>
power = Get power... 0 0<br></code>
<code>
echo The power of this sound is 'power' Pascal-squared.<br></code>
<p>
The first line of this script executes the menu command <b>Get power...</b>, but puts the value 0.1350605005239421 into the variable <code>power</code> instead of into the Info window (the variable can have any name you like, as long as it starts with a lower-case letter and consists of letters and digits; see <a href="Scripting_5_1__Variables.html">Scripting 5.1. Variables</a>).</p>
<p>
The second line then reports the value in the Info window, this time with a nice text around it.</p>
